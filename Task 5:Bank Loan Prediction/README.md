# 💼 Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
# 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer. This insight enables banks to tailor marketing strategies, target the right customer segments, and increase loan acceptance rates effectively.

# 📊 Dataset Overview
Name: Bank Marketing Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Size: Approximately 41,188 records × 21 features

Target Variable: y — whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (loan accepted) (binary: yes/no)

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Key Steps Executed:

Performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset structure and feature distributions

Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for model compatibility

Cleaned and normalized feature names for ease of use

# 🧠 Model Development
Implemented classification models: Decision Tree (primary) with potential for Logistic Regression

Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets to evaluate model performance on unseen data

Trained models on encoded features to learn patterns related to loan acceptance

# 📈 Model Evaluation
Assessed model accuracy on the test set

Used confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) to analyze prediction quality

Identified important features influencing loan acceptance decisions using feature importance scores

# 🔍 Exploratory Visualizations & Insights
Visualized distributions of key features such as age, marital status, and job type against loan acceptance

Found distinct customer groups with higher likelihood to accept loans based on demographic and financial factors

Demonstrated imbalance in the target variable with a majority rejecting the loan offer, emphasizing the need for careful model tuning

# 🛠️ Skills & Techniques Applied
Comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis

Encoding categorical variables for machine learning compatibility

Classification modeling using Decision Trees

Model performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

Feature importance analysis for business insights

Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

# 🧾 Included Files
personal_loan_acceptance.ipynb — Full Jupyter Notebook detailing EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization

README.md — Project documentation and summary

# ✨ Conclusion
This project delivers a robust classification model to predict personal loan acceptance using customer demographic and financial data. The insights and feature importance results provide actionable guidance for banks to refine marketing campaigns and improve customer targeting, ultimately boosting loan subscription rates.
