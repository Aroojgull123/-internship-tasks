# 🌸 Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we aim to understand feature distributions, visualize species patterns, and identify which features are most useful for distinguishing between the three iris species.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Scikit-learn / UCI ML Repository  
- **Shape:** 150 rows × 5 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `species` (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation

### ✔️ Steps Performed:
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Explored structure using `.head()`, `.shape`, `.columns`
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Renamed columns for clarity if needed

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ✔️ Visualizations:
- **Scatter Plots** to compare petal/sepal length vs width
- **Histograms** to analyze the distribution of each feature
- **Box Plots** to detect outliers and compare feature spread across species
- Species visually separated using **Seaborn’s `hue` parameter**

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Petal measurements** (length and width) are more effective at distinguishing species than sepal features.
- **Setosa** species stands out clearly due to its smaller petal sizes.
- Visual patterns helped identify species separability without even modeling.
