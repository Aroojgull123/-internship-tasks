**Task 1 – Iris Dataset Analysis**

**📌 Objective**

The goal of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The objective is to understand data patterns, identify species differences, and apply basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

**🛠️ Approach**

**✅ Data Loading & Exploration**

Loaded the Iris dataset using Pandas.

Explored structure using .shape, .head(), and .columns.

Reviewed unique species and basic distribution of features.

**✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

Verified there were no missing values in the dataset.

Renamed columns if necessary for clarity.

**✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Created scatter plots using Seaborn to visualize petal/sepal relationships.

Plotted histograms using Matplotlib to view distributions.

Used box plots to detect outliers across features.

Separated species visually based on petal measurements.

**📊 Results and Insights**

Petal features (length and width) are more useful for species classification than sepal features.

Setosa species is the easiest to distinguish based on its smaller petal sizes.

Visualizations clearly helped understand how different features impact classification.
